# Introducing BIBCAT - a BIBFRAME Catalog

The Library of Congress efforts to replace MARC21 with a new linked-data 
vocabulary called BIBFRAME is generating much discussion in the library 
community. A new open-source library catalog 
and digital repository called BIBCAT - a project funded by the Library of 
Congress - demonstrates what a new linked-data catalog could look 
like for libraries and with a prototype available at http://bibcat.org/. 
 
## Introduction
The library's catalog, usually the core of what is called the library's
integrated library systems and now being marketed as "library services
platform" (Breeding 2012), touches most areas of the library's
operations, collections, and public services. The functionality needed
to support acquisition and circulation work-flows - not mention the
increasingly complex electronic resource management for journals and
e-books - traditionally requires these large enterprise software systems
to include all this functionality into large monolithic "black-boxes".

In the Spring 2014 issue of Reference and User Services Quarterly, Diane
Cmor and Rory Litwin argue if libraries should keep the traditional
library OPAC in favor of discovery systems or what Athena Hoeppner
describes as "web-scale discovery services" (Hoeppner 2012). Cmor's
position, that because library patrons prefer to using discovery systems
to the traditional OPAC for finding the library's materials, the added
costs of maintaining two separate systems argue in favor of dropping or
eliminating the traditional library ILS/OPAC or catalog. Litwin's
counter-argument for retaining the traditional catalog revolve around
the catalog's utility for advanced searching by scholars and experts is
better for their specific information needs than the current crop of
discovery systems that focus on the general undergraduate at a academic
library.(Cmor and Litwin 2014)

Although that might not have been the intentions of either Cmor or
Litwin in their debate on retiring the library catalog, there is another
alternative to what either of them suggest for library catalog. Instead
of purchasing a commercial discovery system or deploying one of the
open-source discovery layer alternatives, libraries should consider if
their rate-of-return on their technology investment for resource
discovery would be better spent through online adverting of their
collections on the major commercial general search like Google or
Microsoft Bing. This radical approach has already been investigated by
libraries as Utrecht University Library, where their student patrons
start their search 83% of the time from a search engine with under 1%
using a online databases and the library website. (Kortekaas 2012)

With such library luminaries as Roy Tennent calling for the demotion of
the library catalog by encouraging libraries to "Take that anachronistic
library catalog and turn it back into what it really only ever was - an
inventory control system." (Tennent 2014) or as Diane Cmor says
"Obviously, we still need back-end catalogs (or the equivalent) to feed
our holdings into our discovery systems, but the user interface is no
longer necessary." (Cmor and Litwin 2014) Lacking from these analysis is
that poor user interface for backend enterprise systems, even stripped
down to bare functionality as envisioned by Tennent and Cmor, have real
and significant costs that are borne by library staff and administration
when trying to accomplish their workflow in the library.

## BIBFRAME - Library of Congress's MARC21 Replacement
BIBFRAME, short for Bibliographic Framework Initiative, refers to both 
the vocabulary as well as the communities and organizations that 
understand the importance of bibliographic data to libraries and other 
cultural heritage institutions. BIBFRAME as described from the Library 
of Congress website, is

    Initiated by the Library of Congress, BIBFRAME provides a foundation 
    for the future of bibliographic description, both on the web, and in 
    the broader networked worldâ€¦In addition to being a replacement for MARC, 
    BIBFRAME serves as a general model for expressing and connecting 
    bibliographic data. A major focus of the initiative will be to determine 
    a transition path for the MARC 21 formats while preserving a robust 
    data exchange that has supported resource sharing and cataloging cost 
    savings in recent decades.  
    (Library of Congress BIBFRAME website, 2015)  

As one of the first adopters of BIBFRAME, Jeremy Nelson's early experiments 
in creating bibliographic discovery layers and
catalogs started by creating a BIBFRAME catalog
using Django, an open-source web front-end and the NoSQL Redis datastore to
store information on BIBFRAME entities. 
Following the Modeling BIBFRAME entities in Redis that gained traction
with the release of the formal BIBFRAME vocabulary at the first
iteration of the http://bibframe.org website. In early 2013, Nelson
published another Code4Lib article(Nelson, 2013), further describes a
Redis-based bibliographic web applications with designs for Linked Data
peer-to-peer and consortia datastores. At the 2013 Code4Lib conference
in Chicago, Nelson co-presented on the current status of his
collaborative work with the University of Denver in a presentation
titled, Evolving Towards a Consortium BIBFRAME Redis Datastore, that
further detailed a multi-institutional BIBFRAME application design.
Invited to present at the BIBFRAME forum at annual ALA conference in the
summer of 2012, Nelson demonstrated a consortium BIBFRAME discovery layer
and catalog that included MARC records from the member institutions of
the Colorado Alliance of Research Libraries, all 40,000+ RDF/XML records
from Project Gutenberg, and over 5,000 MODS records harvested from
Colorado College's Fedora 2.7 digital repository. An example of this minimum
viable product of catalog is still accessible at
http://tuttdemo.coloradocollege.edu/.  


## Catalog Pull Platform Simplifying and De-coupling Library Technology

With ideas originating in the Lean Startup movement for technology 
entrepreneurs and that builds upon the success Toyota and other 
manufacturers have had in implementing Lean Manufacturing ideas; the 
Catalog Pull Platform is a fundamental shift in thinking about library 
systems. Moving away from trying to anticipate the needs and then 
"pushing" services and technology to patrons and staff, the 
Catalog Pull Platform instead identifies and responds to needs and 
demands for library technology by "pulling" directly from various 
constituencies served by libraries and cultural heritage organizations.

Developing the Catalog Pull Platform  at Colorado College centers
around creating simple, standalone web applications with minimal
external dependencies. Some of these applications replaces lengthly
manual MARC-based workflows for normalizing MARC records for Tutt
Library's legacy ILS along with the indexing into the Aristotle
Discovery Layer. Other Fedora-based institutional repository utilities
including staff productivity tools that allowed repository managers to
easy move collections around in Fedora as well as batch templates that
added one to any number of stub Fedora objects that shared similar
metadata and were all co-located in the same collection. These
linked-data vocabularies were also examined to see they could be used
for operational improvement of library services and expansion of access
to the library's patrons. This philosophy offers loosely coupled
components for rapid, iterative, Lean Startup inspired (Ries 2012)
Build-Measure-Learn software development cycles for Colorado College's
linked data research, experiments, and digital services. The highest
profile project is a new catalog with a Fedora 4 and Flask-based
semantic server made up of Colorado College's MARC records that have
been converted to BIBFRAME and Schema.org linked data.

Inspired by John Hegel III's and John Seely Brown's early conception a
pull platforms, the Tutt Library has embarked on approach for library
catalog software development that emphasis emergent design, loosely
coupled, people focused with incremental cycles that provide immediate
feedback from the end users of these services (Hegal II and Brown 2008).
The current technical infrastructure includes open-source projects like
Fedora Commons and Elastic search for RDF and datastream management and
search functionality while supporting existing MARC21 works and newer
command-line and web-based tools for manipulating RDF graphs of BIBFRAME
and schema.org vocabularies. 

## BIBCAT 
In the fall of 2014, the Library of Congress solicited bids for a new 
BIBFRAME Search and Display system. Aaron Schmidt of Influx Library User 
Interface Design and Jeremy Nelson successful proposal is  BIBCAT - BIBFRAME 
Catalog the basis for open-source the BIBFRAME Catalog (shortened to BIBCAT) 
and a backend BIBFRAME Datastore that extends the Semantic Server REST API. 

The Semantic Server is an open-source REST API wrapper that for managing RDF 
entities stored as subject graphs. The current iteration uses Fedora 4 as a 
subject linked-data store and binary preservation store while providing 
expanded and enriched search of these RDF entities through Elastic Search 
supported by an HTTP SPARQL endpoint using Blazegraph.

BIBCAT's current demonstration release is live at http://bibcat.org/ and 
currently has loaded sample MARC21 records from the Library of Congress with 
additional contribution of MARC records from the Colorado Alliance of Research
Libraries and Colorado College. The second development iteration of BIBCAT
continued through 2015 with an additional contract from the Library of Congress
to add a reporting and analytics module to BIBCAT. 

BIBCAT's current user interface is deliberately stripped down and simplfied to
a single search input box that dynamically provides typeahead search completion 
as a patron enters a search query. Search results from either the typeahead 
search or running a search query from the search box generates a listing of 
results that as the patron scrolls down the page are dynamically loaded in
a technique similar to how Netflix and Facebook implement their search results
and social streaming. Patrons can also resort their search results as well as
narrow their search focus through dynamic cluster of their results by BIBFRAME
Resource categories like Work, Instance, Topic, and Agent.

## Reimagining the Colorado College Library's TIGER Catalog and Website

An ongoing experiment for replacing Colorado College's legacy ILS, the first 
iteration of the TIGER Catalog Minimum Viable Product was released in 2014 
using Aaron Schmidt's design he outlined in a blog posting (Schmidt, 2014). 
The first release of this TIGER catalog illustrated the front-end viability 
of using Flask and is currently available at http://catalog.coloradocollege.edu/.

Requirements gathering and project planning is continuing for the next
release of the TIGER catalog that will extend the user interface being 
developed for BIBCAT as a base platform for creating and eventually replacing
current library operational workflows that focus on the library's legacy ILS.  
With the current topology of the Catalog Pull Platform that separates the 
library's linked data from any specific front-end application, Tutt Library
is just beginning to explore the research and operational possibilities of
providing comprehensive library linked-data services to the library and to 
the larger Colorado College campus. Part of these linked data services is moving knowledge,
in the form of RDF statements of fact about the library's physical and
digital resources coupled with organizational structures and history feed into an
emerging common institutional knowledge graph for Colorado College. These services
are also being integrated into Tutt Library's website as an improvement to the current
method of information architecture and management of these statements of fact that 
are at the core of a RDF triples made up subjects, predicates, and objects.

By becoming institutional authority and linked data publisher of record for the college, the 
library's continues to evolve its role to maintain it's relevancy on the 
modern liberal art college campus.
