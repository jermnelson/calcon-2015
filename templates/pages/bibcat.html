    <h2>BIBCAT</h2>
    <p>In 2014 the Library of Congress issued an RFQ for a BIBFRAME "search and display"
     system to highlight BIBFRAME.
     Aaron Schmidt of Influx Library User Interface Design and Jeremy Nelson were awarded the contract with 
     the Library of Congress that resulted in BIBCAT - a BIBFRAME Catalog - a lightweight catalog web 
     application that uses the backend BIBFRAME Datastore. The current pilot that is loaded with sample 
     datasets from the Library of Congress (original records were generated from MARC records related to the subjects, 
     "Mark Twain" and "Bible")</p>
